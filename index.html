    <p>I was born and raised in the greater Cincinnati area and went to Little Miami Schools. Being on a competitive dance team for 11 years was a big part of my life, teaching me discipline and teamwork. I'm also an animal lover, with two cats&#128049 and a dog&#128054 who are always there to make me smile.</p>
    
    <p>I love to travel and have visited places like Florida, the Outer Banks, Colorado, Northern California, and Canada. New York City is a favorite destination; I've been there five times to enjoy things like the Thanksgiving Day Parade and Broadway shows. Back in Cincinnati, I’ve had season tickets to the Cincinnati Broadway Series for nearly 15 years, with "The Phantom of the Opera" being one of my top favorites.</p>
    
    <p>Music and entertainment are important to me, and I’ve been to concerts (microphone and music note emoji) by artists like Taylor Swift and Green Day. Reading thrillers, especially by Stephen King, and watching horror movies like "Scream" are some of my hobbies. Meeting celebrities like Neve Campbell and the cast from "Stranger Things" has been exciting for me.</p>
    
    <p>I also enjoy outdoor activities like fishing, hiking, and kayaking. I'm a big fan of the Steelers, Michigan, and the New York Rangers and have been lucky to watch games at their stadiums. At home, I love binge-watching old TV shows like "Friends" and "Vampire Diaries." I’m exploring career options and am interested in media design or theater production, where I can combine my love for creativity and the arts.</p>
